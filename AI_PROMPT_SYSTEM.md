## Economics

**Cost per user (Premium):**

## How It Learns

### From the Prompt:

Extracts:
- Spirit: mezcal (+5% weight)

```

### From AI Suggestions:
```typescript
AI suggests:
1. Mezcal Margarita (mezcal, citrus, sweet)
2. Oaxaca Old Fashioned (mezcal, bitter)
3. Smoky Paloma (mezcal, citrus, spicy)

Updates:
- mezcal: +6% (appears in all 3)
- citrus: +4% (appears in 2)
- spicy: +2% (appears in 1)
- bitter: +2% (appears in 1)
```

### When User Saves:
```typescript

STRONG signal (+15%):
- mezcal: +15%
- citrus: +15%

```

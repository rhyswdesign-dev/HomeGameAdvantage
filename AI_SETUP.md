# AI Recipe Formatting Setup

## Overview

The app includes AI-powered recipe formatting that transforms saved links and text into structured recipe cards with ingredients, instructions, garnish details, and more.

## Development Mode

By default, the app runs in development mode with mock AI responses when:
- No OpenAI API key is provided
- The API key is set to the default placeholder: `your-openai-api-key-here`

Development mode provides realistic mock responses for testing the UI and user flow.

## Production Setup

To enable real AI features, you have two options:

### Option 1: Quick Setup (OpenAI Only)
For basic AI recipe formatting and image analysis:

1. Get an OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Update your `.env` file: `EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here`
3. Restart: `npx expo start --clear`

**Features Enabled**: Recipe formatting, Vision AI image analysis
**Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per recipe

### Option 2: Full Setup (OpenAI + Google Cloud)
For complete AI features including OCR text extraction:

1. Get OpenAI API key (see above)
2. Get Google Cloud Vision API key from [console.cloud.google.com](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
3. Update your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-key-here
   EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY=your-google-cloud-key-here
   ```
4. Restart: `npx expo start --clear`

**Features Enabled**: All AI features
**Cost**: ~$0.01-0.03 per recipe + ~$0.001-0.005 per OCR image

- Temperature: 0.3 (for consistent formatting)
- Max tokens: 1000

## Development Notes

### File Structure
- `src/services/aiRecipeFormatter.ts` - Main AI service
- `src/screens/AIRecipeFormatScreen.tsx` - Preview/edit UI
- `src/screens/RecipesScreen.tsx` - Integration point

### Mock Response
Development mode returns a structured mock recipe with:
- Realistic ingredient lists
- Step-by-step instructions
- Appropriate garnish suggestions
- Proper glassware recommendations
- Difficulty and timing estimates

### Error Handling
- Network failures gracefully fall back to manual formatting
- Invalid API keys show appropriate error messages
- Malformed responses trigger retry options
